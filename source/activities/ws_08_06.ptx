      <objectives>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> Given a function and a point inside its domain, find a power series which converges
              to the given function on an open interval centered at the given point. This is called
              briefly a <alert>power series
                representation</alert> of the function at the point. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Integrate and differentiate power series.
            </p>
