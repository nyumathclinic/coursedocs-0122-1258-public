            <p>
              A city has a population of 100000. One day a rumor begins to spread about
              phenylethylamine in the drinking water. Initially two people in the town have heard
              the rumor but within a week 10000 people have heard it.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Assume that the spread of a rumor is proportional to the number of people who have
                not heard the rumor. Write an initial-value problem modeling the rumor’s spread.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Now assume that the spread of a rumor is jointly proportional to the number of
                people who have heard and who have not heard the rumor. Write an initial-value
                problem modeling the rumor’s spread.

                Draw slope fields modeling each of your differential equations in the last problem.
                What do predictions can you make about the eventual spread of the rumor? Which model
                seems more realistic?

                Solve the more realistic initial-value problem explicitly. How long until half the
                population of the town has heard the rumor?
