                <p>
                    This problem set is designed to reinforce your understanding of the foundational concepts of integration, covering material from Sections 5.1-5.5 of Stewart's Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th Edition.
                    It aims to challenge you with problems ranging from direct application to extended thinking, and should take an average of 3 hours to complete.
