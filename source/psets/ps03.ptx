      <title>Problem Set 3</title>
      <subtitle>Trigonometric Substitution and Partial Fractions </subtitle>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          This problem set consists not only of problems similar to what you've seen, but
          also of unique problems you may not have seen before.
          The purpose is for you to apply the concepts you've previously
          learned to new, unfamiliar, and usually more interesting situations.
          In some cases, problems connect ideas from multiple learning objectives.
        </p>

        <p> Write full, clear solutions to the problems below. Although the final answer is
          important, being able to convey you understand the underlying concepts is more important.
          So show your work and explain your steps. Write complete sentences in English to connect
          your mathematical statements. Do not use the three-dots notation (∴ or ∵) when you mean <q>
          therefore</q> or <q>because</q>. Do not use an arrow (→) when you mean equals (=) or <q>this
          implies</q> or <q>and now the next step is…</q>. Use the worked examples in the textbook, or
          on solution sets to worksheets or previous problem sets, as a guide for how to write your
          solutions. </p>

        <p>Written work should be neat and legible.
          Other than being written in longhand, your work should be as clean as something you would
          turn in for one of your writing classes.
          Write in linear order from left to right and top to bottom.
          Leave ample space for graders to write their comments.
          (Do not upload the exercise sheet with your answers written in the margins.)
          Setting aside one page per exercise is a good rule of thumb.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prepare a single PDF and submit it to Gradescope.
          Mark the page of each exercise when you upload your pset.
          Make sure each page is in the proper orientation.
