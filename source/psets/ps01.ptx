      <introduction>
        <p>
          This problem set is designed to reinforce your understanding of the foundational concepts of integration, covering material from Sections 5.1-5.5 of Stewart's Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th Edition.
          It aims to challenge you with problems ranging from direct application to extended thinking, and should take an average of 3 hours to complete.

      <exercise xml:id="exercise-area-approximation">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Estimate the area under the curve <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=5</m> using four rectangles.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Use <em>right endpoints</em>.
                Sketch the graph and the rectangles.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Repeat the estimation using <em>left endpoints</em>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Explain why one estimate is an overestimate and the other is an underestimate.
