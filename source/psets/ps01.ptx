            <title>Problem Set 1</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    This problem set consists not only of problems similar to what you've seen, but also of unique problems you may not have seen before.
                    The purpose of the latter is for you to apply the concepts you've previously learned to new, unfamiliar, and usually more interesting situations.
                    In some cases, problems connect ideas from multiple learning objectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Write full, clear solutions to the problems below.
                    It is important that the logic of how you solved these problems is clear.
                    Although the final answer is important, being able to convey you understand the underlying concepts is more important.
