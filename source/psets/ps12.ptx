      <title>Problem Set 12</title>
      <subtitle>Integration in Polar Coordinates</subtitle>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          This problem set focuses on applications of integration in polar coordinates, including
          finding areas and arc lengths of polar curves.
        </p>
        <p>
          These problems are for pratice only, and will not be collected or graded. Solutions will
          be released before the final exam.
