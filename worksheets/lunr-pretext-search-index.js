Summary of integration techniques     Simplify the integrand if possible, and use procedural rules to break down the integral (distribute across sums, pull out constants, etc.)    Use the basic formulas like Formulas 1–20 in your table of integrals on reference page 6 (back pages). These are worth memorizing.    Make any substitution that will transform the integral into a simpler one.    Classify the integrand by form :     Integration by parts.     Polynomials are a good choice of because they get simpler when differentiating.    Inverse functions like , , are also a good choice of because they get simpler when differentiating.    Remember also that the product of an exponential and a sine or cosine can be integrated by parts twice.       Trigonometric forms:      :     If is odd, save and let .    If is odd, save and let .    If and are even, use half-angle identities to write in terms of and repeat.        :     If is odd, save and let .    If is even, save and let .    If is even and is odd, use the identity to write the integrand in terms of odd powers of secant. Then use the reduction formula (Formula 77 on reference page 9).          Radical forms: try a trigonometric substitution.     Form : let , so and .    Form : let , so and .    Form : let , so and .       Rational forms: try partial fraction decomposition after factoring the denominator.     For each power of linear factor of the denominator, the partial fraction decomposition contains terms of the form (This includes the case where there is just a single factor of in the denominator of the original function and a single summand .)    For each power of an irreducible quadratic factor of the form , the partial fraction decomposition contains terms of the form (Again, if there is only one summand.)    As a check, remember the number of unknowns must be equal to the degree of the denominator to guarantee a unique solution.          Still stuck? Try some of these.     Manipulate the integrand:     Multiply by with some clever choice of numerator and denominator    Rationalize the numerator.    Rationalize the denominator.       Relate the problem to a previously worked one.    Pick something and substitute that.    Consult a table of integrals or computer software.                 Use a partial fraction decomposition            Substitute and . The integral becomes .           Substitute and . The integral becomes .           Substitute and . The integral becomes .           Break it up:            Substitute , so and . The integral becomes . Now you can do partial fractions on the integrand .           The denominator factors as and the two quadratic factors are irreducible (use the discriminant to show that they have non-real roots). So the partial fraction decomposition takes the form            Complete the square in the denominator: . Then substitute , . The integral becomes .           Substitute and .
